          <p class="para1">VALORANT is a free-to-play game of precise skill, high stakes, lethal gameplay, and clutch moments.
                  VALORANT pits two teams of five against each other to win a round-based, attackers vs defenders, best-of-24-rounds gunfight.</p>

          <h2 class="header2">Gameplay</h2>
          <p class="para2">VALORANT has 7 game modes that a player can choose from: <b>Unrated, Competitive, Spike Rush, Swiftplay, Deathmath, Escalation, and
              Custom.</b> 
          </p>

          <h2 class="header3">Maps</h2>
          <p class="para3">Players are randomly loaded into any one of the 9 maps that are available in game at the start of a match;
              <b>Lotus, Pearl, Fracture, Breeze, Icebox, Bind, Haven, Split, and 
              Ascent</b>. Some maps have secret entrances that can be used to sneak up on enemies
              while others have towers that players can play off of in order to get a higher angle advantage.

          <h2 class="header4">Agent Roles</h2>
          <p class="para4">Prior to starting a match in VALORANT, you get to pick and play as one of the 22 agents that this game has to offer. These agents are
              grouped up into 4 classes: <b>Controllers</b>, <b>Duelists</b>, <b>Initiators,</b> and <b>Sentinals</b>. Most players lean towards a specific class and
              tend to play the agents within that class depending on how comfortable they are with what each class has to offer in terms of abilities and gameplay.
